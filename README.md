# ðŸ§­ HR Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)
## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project presents an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI, designed to help HR departments and leadership teams track workforce trends, attrition, and salary insights in a clear, actionable format.

The dashboard consolidates HR data such as employee demographics, education levels, job roles, salary structures, and attrition metrics, allowing decision-makers to identify workforce patterns and areas for improvement.

The uploaded dataset contains sample data created solely for demonstration purposes. The actual dataset has not been shared due to data security and confidentiality reasons.
